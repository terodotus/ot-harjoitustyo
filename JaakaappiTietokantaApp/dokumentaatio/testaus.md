# Testing documentation

## Overview
The FridgeApp testing is handled with automatized unit testing throughout the development phase and the app lifecycle. The aim was to go to test driven mode, and it succeeded. When adding new features, the automated tests quickly gave information if they still worked or not, so the developer could see if new feature broke something or not. To maintain test-driven mode, automated tests had to be updated constantly and all the time. In addition to automatized unit tests, there is manual system level testing ongoing all the time by the developer. 

## Unit testing and integration testing

## System testing

### Installation and integration testing for releases
The FridgeApp system testing is handled manually by the developer. The app has been downloaded and installed by using the given [user guide documentation](https://github.com/terodotus/ot-harjoitustyo/blob/master/JaakaappiTietokantaApp/dokumentaatio/kayttoohje.md).
